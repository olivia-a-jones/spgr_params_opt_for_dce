# Interactive SPGR signal analysis for optimising parameters for a brain DCE-MRI scan

This repository contains an interactive tool to visualise how modifying scan parameters (repitition time, flip angle) change the signal and T1-sensitivity of a SPGR scan, with a view to selecting optimised parameters for detecting subtle blood-brain barrier leakage. T10 (aka target tissue) and concentration (amount of BBB leakage) can also be changed to assess how the signal will change in the context of BBB leakage.
